He was the son of Raja Bhagwant Das and the younger brother of Man Singh I. After the decline of the Mughal Empire and the famine of 1783, the population of this place declined almost completely. This place is also known to be one of the most haunted places in the world and is called “The House of Ghosts” by the locals here',
